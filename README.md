# âœ¨ Weiss Carousel

## Get Started
```
npm start
```

### Next steps:
- Use Typescript
- Add Responsive breakpoints
- Add an opaque white background to background of the non-primary element. 
    - ::before based approach in image.css is not working.
- Rethink the absolute positioning image approach. Maybe use CSS grid?
